 <h1> XSCHEM ELEMENTS</h1><br>

  <h3> WIRES </H3>
  <p>
   Wires in XSCHEM are the equivalent of copper traces in printed circuit boards or electrical conductors.
   Wires are drawn as lines but the electrical connectivity graph is built by XSCHEM.
   To draw a wire segment point the mouse somewhere in the drawing window and press the <kbd>'w'</kbd> key. 
   A rubber wire is shown with one end following the mouse. Clicking the left mouse button
   finishes the placement. The following picture shows a set of connected wires. There are many 
   wire segments but only 3 electrical nodes. XSCHEM recognizes connection of wires and uses this 
   information to build up the circuit connectivity. All wires are drawn on the 'wire' layer. One 
   electrical node in the picture below has been highlighted in red (this is a XSCHEM function we 
   will cover later on).
  </p>

  <h3> LINES </h3>
  <p>
   Lines are just segments that are used for drawing. Lines do not have any electrical meaning, in fact
   when building the circuit netlist, lines are completely ignored. XSCHEM uses different layers to draw 
   lines. Each layer has its own color, allowing to draw with different colors. Lines are placed like
   wires, but using the <kbd>'l'</kbd> key. The 'Layers' menu allows to select various different layers (colors) 
   for the line.
  </p>
  <img src="xschem_lines.png">
  <h3> RECTANGLES </h3>
  <p>
   Rectangles like Lines are drawable on multiple layers, and also do not carry any electrical information.
   A specific 'PIN' layer is used to make pins that are used to interconnect wires and components.
   Different fill styles (or no fill) can be defined for each layer. Rectangles are placed with the 
   <kbd>'r'</kbd> bindkey
  </p>
  <img src="xschem_rectangles.png">
  <h3> POLYGONS </h3>
  <p>
   Polygons are paths that can be drawn on any layer. Placements begins with the <kbd>'ctrl-w'</kbd> key
   and continues as long as the user clicks points on the drawing area. Placement ends when:</p>
   <ul>
   <li> the last point is coincident to the first point.</li>
   <li>  or by clicking the <kbd>right mouse button</kbd>,  for an open polygon. </li>
   <li>  or by hitting the <kbd>Return</kbd> key, for a closed polygon
         (this can be done also by clicking the last point coincident to the first polygon point).</li>
   </ul>
  <p>
  A <kbd>fill=true</kbd> attribute may be given to have the shape filled with the layer fill style.
  </p>
  <img src="xschem_polygons.png">
  <h3> CIRCLES / ARCS </h3>
  <p> 
   Arcs may be placed by hitting the <kbd>Shift-C</kbd> key. First click the start point, then the end point. 
   Moving the mouse will show the arc passing thru the 2 points and the mouse waypoint. 
   Clicking will place the arc.
   Arcs may be modified after creation by selecting in stretch mode (<kbd> Ctrl-Button1-drag </kbd>) one of the arc ends
   or the arc center:<br>
   - (end point selected in stretch mode): by starting a move (<kbd>m</kbd>) 
      operation and moving the mouse the arc sweep may be changed.<br>
   - (start point selected in stretch mode):by starting a move (<kbd>m</kbd>) operation and moving the mouse the start arc angle may be changed.<br>
   - (arch center selected in stretch mode): by starting a move (<kbd>m</kbd>) operation and moving the mouse the arc radius may be changed.<br>
   If a circle is needed then use the <kbd>Ctrl-Shift-C</kbd> key combination.
   <br>A <kbd>fill=true</kbd> attribute may be given to have the shape filled with the layer fill style.
  </p>
  <img src="xschem_elements_01.png">

  <h3> TEXT </h3>
  <p>
   Text can be placed with the <kbd>'t'</kbd> bindkey. 
   A dialog box appears where the user inputs the text and text size. 
  </p>
  <img src="xschem_texts.png">
  <p>
   The <kbd>layer</kbd> property can be used
   to draw text on a different layer, for example, setting <kbd>layer=6</kbd> will draw on cyan color. 
   A <kbd>font</kbd> property is defined to change the default font.
   A <kbd>hcenter=true</kbd> attribute may be set to center text in the reading direction, 
   while <kbd>vcenter=true</kbd> centers text in the perpendicular (to reading) direction.
   the 2 attributes may be set both to get full centered text box.<br>
   A <kbd>weight=bold</kbd> attribute may be given for bold text, while a <kbd>slant=italic</kbd> or
   <kbd>slant=oblique</kbd> may specify italic or slanted text.

   You wil learn in the <a href="xschem_properties.html">xschem properties chapter</a>
   how to set, edit and change object properties.

  <h3> SYMBOLS </h3>
  <p>
   Symbols are graphical elements that represent electrical components. A symbol represents an electronic
   device, like for example a resistor, a bipolar transistor, an amplifier etc. As you can see graphically 
   symbols are built with lines, rectangles, polygons and texts, the graphical primitives shown before.
   In the picture below some components are placed in a schematic window. Components are instances of symbols.
   For example you see three placements of the 'npn' bipolar transistor symbol. 
   Like in C++, where objects are instances of classes, here components are instances of symbols.
  </p>
  <img src="xschem_symbols.png">
  <p>
   Symbols (like schematic drawings) are stored in xschem libraries. 
   For XSCHEM a library is just a directory placed under the 
   XSCHEM_LIBRARY_PATH directory, see the <a href="install_xschem.html">installation slide</a>.
   A symbol is stored in a .sym file.

  <p>
   To place a symbol in the schematic window press the <kbd>'Insert'</kbd> key. A file chooser pops up, 
   go to the xschem devices directory (<kbd>.../share/xschem/xschem_library/devices</kbd> in the distribution
   by default) and select a symbol (res.sym for example).
   The selected symbol will be instantiated as a component in the schematic at the mouse
   pointer coordinates.
